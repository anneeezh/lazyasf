### Biological Bases of Behavior

Everything that is psychological is simultaneously biological. 



#### Biology, Behavior, & Mind

##### 1. *phrenology* (Franz Gall)

- localization and function - there are certain locations of the brain  that do a certain functions.

##### 2. biological psychology

a. biopsychosocial systems 



#### Neural Communication

##### 1. neuron (nerve cells)

a. basic unit of the nervous system



#### Neurons

##### 1. parts of a neuron

a. cell body - the cell's life support center

b. dendrite - receive messages from other side.

c. axon - passes messages away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles or glands.

d, myelin sheath - covers the axon of some neurons and helps speed neural impulses

​	i. multiple sclerosis



Neural impulse (action potential) - electrical charge that travels down an axon and is generated by the movement of positively charged atoms in and out of channels in the axon’s membrane.



#### Need for Speed 

##### 1. speed of a neural impulse

a. range from 2 to 180 MPH

b. milliseconds



#### Doing Work

##### 1. action potential - stimulated enough

##### 2. resting potential - not getting enough stimulation

##### 3. selectively permeable 

##### 4. depolarizes - domino effect

##### 5. refractory period 



#### More on Neurons

##### 1. threshold

##### 2. all-on-none response



#### How they communicate

##### 1. <u>synapse</u>

##### 2. *synaptic gap (cleft)*

##### 3. <u>neurotransmitters</u>

##### 4. <u>reuptake</u>



#### Neurotransmitters

##### *1. acetylcholine (AcH)*

##### 2. dopamine

##### 3. serotonin

##### 4. norepinephrine

##### 5. GABA

##### 6. glutamate

##### 7. <u>endorphins</u> - chemical in the system that help us with the pain



#### Drugs and Other Chems

##### 1. <u>agonist</u>

##### 2. <u>antagonists</u>

Both 1&2: Can influence what we think and feel in a different way...
