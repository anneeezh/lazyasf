### Studying Genetics & Environmental Influences on Intelligence



#### <u>Twin & Adoption Studies</u>

##### 1. Identical twin studies

###### a. polygenetic

- many genes

###### b. heritability 

- everything has heritability

##### 2. adoptive children studies



#### <u>Heritability</u>

- identical twins who reared together get very similar score in intelligence test
- the similarity of intelligence scores for identical twins who reared apart has lower correlation tan identical twins reared together, this shows that there's some environmental effects
- fraternal twins reared together has lower correlation than identical twins, which shows genetic effects.



#### <u>Environmental Influences</u>

##### 1. early environmental influences

###### a. *tutored human enrichment*

â€‹	i. targeted training

##### 2. schooling and intelligence

###### a. Project Head Start
